CHANGES
=======

2.0.1
-----

Fix pacthing of the makemessages command to work for Django later than 1.11.

2.0.0
-----

Thank you to @karlrl for the following changes:

- Support Python 3.7-3.10
- Support Django 2.2-4.1
- Drop support for Python<3.7 and Django<3.2

1.3.9
-----

- In order to support the latest versions of Django, removed dependence on the
  FILE_CHARSET setting.  This means that the templates will always be read as
  UTF-8.

1.3.8
-----

- Bug fix: Update to work with Django 1.9

1.3.7
-----

- Bug fix: Fail silently when using an invalid regex to match templates.

1.3.6
-----

- Bug fix: Fix the case on ``innerHTML`` (was ``innerHtml``)

1.3.5
-----

- Use ``document.getElementById`` and ``innerHtml`` instead of depending on jQuery
  to get the text of handlebars templates.
- Switch the order of precompiling and registering partials in handlebars tag,
  so that partials can used compiled template.

1.3.4
-----

- Fix compatibility with Python 3.2. Explicity unicode literals (i.e., u'...')
  are not supported in Python 3.2 and cause a syntax error. Support was revived
  in Python 3.3. Python 2.6 and 2.7 allow using unicode string literals by
  default with `from __future__ import unicode_literals`, so we use that here.

1.3.3
-----

- Sort translatable strings so that results are consistent across Python
  versions.

1.3.2
-----

- All template renderers handle unicode characters.

1.3.1
-----

- Bug fix: Closure that was registering Handlbars partials was not wrapped in
  parentheses.

1.3.0
-----

- Add a short translation form::

      {{ _ 'this is translatable' }}

1.2.1
-----

- Allow optional precompiling and and registering of partials for the
  Handlebars.js tag. For example::

      {% handlebarsjs '(.*)' precompile register_partials }

  This will add a `templates` object to `Handlebars`, and register all
  templates for use as partials.

1.2.0
-----

- Add Handlebars.js support

1.1.1
-----

- Fix setup script requirements

1.1.0

- Hijack the makemessages command to find js template messages as well.

0.6.0
-----

- Add ``dustjs`` tag to insert a script block to create a compiled dustjs
  template.  Thanks to `Gehan Gonsalkorale <https://github.com/gehan>`_.

0.5.0
-----

- Add ``mustacheraw`` tag to insert just the raw text of a mustacehe template.
  Thanks to Greg Hinch.

- Add ``mustacheich`` tag to insert a mustache script block as icanhaz expects.

0.4.1 (2012.01.09)
------------------

- Fixed template reading to explicitly decode template file contents using
  Django's ``FILE_CHARSET`` setting. Thanks Eduard Iskandarov.

- Fixed template-finding failure with non-normalized directories in
  ``MUSTACHEJS_DIRS``. Thanks Eduard Iskandarov for report and patch.


0.4.0
-----

- Add the MUSTACHEJS_EXTS configuration variable for specifying the extensions
  allowed for template files located by the FilesystemFinder (and, by extension,
  the AppFinder).


0.3.3
-----

- Add a package_data value to the setup call


0.3.2
-----

- Add the MANIFEST.in file itself as an entry in MANIFEST.in.


0.3.0
-----

- Change the name from django-icanhaz to django-mustachejs.
- Remove dependency on ICanHaz.js.  I like the library, but the maintainers
  were not responsive enough for now.  Use Mustache.js straight, with a little
  bit of minimal sugar.  Templates are rendered to straight Javascript.


0.2.0 (2011.06.26)
------------------

- Made template-finding more flexible: ``ICANHAZ_DIR`` is now ``ICANHAZ_DIRS``
  (a list); added ``ICANHAZ_FINDERS``, ``ICANHAZ_APP_DIRNAMES``, and finding of
  templates in installed apps.


0.1.0 (2011.06.22)
------------------

- Initial release.
